Coupled Multiwavelet Neural Operator Learning for Coupled Partial Differential Equations

## Setup

### Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8
- **Framework**: Pytorch 1.8
- **Additional Requirement**: CUDA 11.0

Please ensure that your system meets these requirements to run the code package effectively.

## Experiments

### Data Generation
- **Matlab Requirement**: The synthetic datasets are generated using Matlab files located in the `Data` folder. Ensure that you have Matlab installed, along with the `chebfun` package.
- **Dataset**: A sample dataset for the non-local Mean Field Game (MFG) problem is available. You can find this under the `MFG data` directory.

### Running Experiments
- **Code Execution**: To run the experiments, navigate to the `model` file. This file contains the necessary codes for executing the experiments related to our project.
