Coupled Multiwavelet Neural Operator Learning for Coupled Partial Differential Equations
## Setup
### Requirements
The code package is developed using Python 3.8 and Pytorch 1.8 with cuda 11.0.
## Experiments
The sample generated dataset for the non-local MFG problem is uploaded at MFG data.  
The codes to run the experiments can be found in the file 'model.'
